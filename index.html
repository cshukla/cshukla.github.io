    <p align="justify"> I am Chinmay Shukla, a graduate student in the Biological
    	and Biomedical Sciences program at Harvard University. 
    	For my thesis project, I am focused on dissecting and 
    	characterizing sequence elements responsible for different
    	functions of long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) under the 
        direction of <a href="http://rinnlab.com">John Rinn</a> and 
        <a href="http://rafalab.github.io"> Rafael Irizarry</a>. 
        Outside lab, I am passionate about reading non-fiction, 
        explaining science to people with non-scientific backgrounds 
        and exploring the world. 
    </p>

    <p align="justify"> This page provides information on my research projects. 
    	I frequently blog on experiences in graduate school at
