title: Outside Lab
---

I believe that to be successful in lab you need to spend time doing things you love outside lab. These activities help me step away from scientific problems, reenergize me and often help mee see completely novel solutions. Plus, its fun! :smile:

Currently, I am mainly focused on 2 things outside lab:

1. Increasing scientific awareness in public through science communication
2. Making graduate student life at Harvard better

#### **Increasing scientific awareness in public through science communication**
I believe that while progress in science achieves great progress for humanity, often scientific progress and ideas are poorly communicated to the public. As a result, the general public often suspects science, "experts" and dismisses scientific claims. Climate change, trade, vaccines are all excellent examples of this phenomenon. To help change this, I work as a science writer for [The Munich Eye](http://themunicheye.com/global_scripts/contributors/index.php?contributor=Chinmay%20Shukla) where I explain recent cutting edge research to the common public in an easy to understand manner. An excellent perk of this work is the chance to interview the best scientists about their work and learn first hand from them. I also try to explain my own work in a simplified manner and blog about it and other experiences in graduate school at [Outside Two Standard Deviations](https://outsidetwostandarddeviations.wordpress.com). Besides, I am also involved with a student group on campus called [Science In The News](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu) and recently gave talk on [break throughs in brain mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwEuoPkcOUA) to Boston residents.
