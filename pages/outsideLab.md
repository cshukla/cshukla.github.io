title: Outside Lab
---

I believe that to be successful in lab you need to spend time doing things you love outside lab. These activities help me step away from scientific problems, reenergize me and often help mee see completely novel solutions. Plus, its fun! :smile:

Currently, I am mainly focused on 2 things outside lab:

1. Increasing science awareness in public through science communication
2. Improving graduate community at Harvard

#### **Increasing science awareness in public through science communication**
I believe that while progress in science achieves great progress for humanity, often scientific progress and ideas are poorly communicated to the public. As a result, the general public often suspects science, "experts" and dismisses scientific claims. Climate change, trade, vaccines are all excellent examples of this phenomenon. To help change this, I work as a science writer for [The Munich Eye](http://themunicheye.com/global_scripts/contributors/index.php?contributor=Chinmay%20Shukla) where I explain recent cutting edge research to the common public in an easy to understand manner. 

An excellent perk of this work is the chance to interview the best scientists about their work and learn first hand from them. I also try to explain my own work in a simplified manner and blog about it and other experiences in graduate school at [Outside Two Standard Deviations](https://medium.com/@outside2SDs). Besides, I am also involved with a student group on campus called [Science In The News](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu) and recently gave talk on [break throughs in brain mapping](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwEuoPkcOUA) to Boston residents.

#### **Improving graduate community at Harvard**
I am actively involved with many different graduate student groups at Harvard. Currently, I serve as [Treasurer of Graduate Student Council](http://gsc.fas.harvard.edu/people/chinmay-shukla) where my role involves managing the budget of the council and awarding grants to other student groups. One of the most fun parts of this job is a chance to have breakfast with various Harvard deans once a month and advocate on behalf of the graduate community. 

The other group I am heavily involved with is the [Harvard Big Data Club](www.harvardbigdata.com) which I co-founded in May 2016. We are the only "tech" graduate student group on campus and are focussed on a). improving tech skills on campus (for example: we hold programming/machine learning workshops) b). acting as a bridge between graduate students and tech companies (for example: we hold career panels with recent graduates working in industry) as well as c). increasing general data science awareness on campus (for example: we recently hosted a keynote with Dr. Bruce Schneier on cybersecurity). Building a student group from the ground up has been one of the most "rollercoaster" experiences.
