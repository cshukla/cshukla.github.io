#### Bio


I'm a joint graduate student at Harvard Medical School with [Dr. Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io) and [Dr. John Rinn](http://rinnlab.com) where I study various sequence modules governing the function of non coding RNA. As a graduate student, I am interested in combining novel functional genomics techniques with simple statistics and data science to uncover fundamental secrets about RNA. I am involved in several student groups on campus including the [Graduate Student Council](http://gsc.fas.harvard.edu/people/chinmay-shukla), [Harvard Biotech Club](http://thebiotechclub.org/leadership-team/) and Harvard India Student Group. I also started a new student group on campus - [Harvard Big Data Association in GSAS (HBDA)](http://harvardbigdata.com). HBDA focuses on building data science skills among students, acting as a bridge between companies and graduate students and raising awareness about data science topics in the wider Harvard community. One of my other major interests is communicating science to the wider public. Currently, I work as a science writer for [The Munich Eye](http://themunicheye.com/global_scripts/contributors/index.php?contributor=Chinmay%20Shukla) writing articles to explain interesting research articles for the regular reader.

Before coming to graduate school at Harvard, I got a bachelors and masters degree in biotechnology from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I loved my time at IIT Madras and after a rocky start in my first semester, I went on to recieve several awards for best acadmeic perfomance. During my time at IIT Madras, I spent a summer doing research at Yale University and another one at University of Wisconsin Madison as a Khorana Scholar. You can read more about my work in IIT Madras [here](http://openwetware.org/wiki/User:Chinmay_Shukla).

My work in graduate school and my external reading has sparked my interest in the healthcare sector. In particular, I am excited by the application of machine learning to optimize the healthcare system and better human life. To get a broad sense of my interests, you can follow me on Twitter.
