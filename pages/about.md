#### Bio

My mission in life is to work on innovative healthcare products which positively transform patient lives and disrupt the life sciences market place by creating substantial social and financial impact. Based on my research experience, I am particularly passionate about products at the intersection of AI and healthcare.

I am a graduate student at Harvard Medical School in [Dr. Rafael Irizarry's](http://rafalab.github.io) lab. I am broadly interested in the field of genomics and I have cultivated extensive skills in both statistics and molecular biology during graduate school. For my thesis project, I have developed a [new high throughput screen](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/09/15/189654) to identify functional regions within RNAs. Further, in order to analyze this new dataset and learn from it, I developed new statistical techniques available now on [GitHub](https://github.com/cshukla/oligoGames).

I am quite excited by start ups and love the feeling of building something new. To investigate start ups more, I spent 3 months from June 2017 to August 2017 at [Flaghsip Pioneering](http://flagshippioneering.com) exploring start up opportunities in several interesting areas including the microbiome, AI driven biotech and immuno oncology. 

I have been very lucky in my life to have amazing mentors who give me great advice and support. As a result, I am passionate about more generally creating a supportive environment for graduate students. To this end, I started a new student group at Harvard focussing on graduate students interested in [data science](http://www.harvardbigdata.com).

If you want to connect with me, message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuklachinmay). I am always up for discussing ideas in data science, machine learning and healthcare.
