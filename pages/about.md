### Bio

I'm a joint graduate student at Harvard Medical School with [Dr. Rafael Irizarry](http://rafalab.github.io) and [Dr. John Rinn](http://rinnlab.com) where I study various sequence modules governing the function of non coding RNA. As a graduate student, I am interested in combining novel functional genomics techniques with simple statistics and data science to uncover fundamental secrets about RNA. I am involved in several student groups on campus including the [Graduate Student Council](http://gsc.fas.harvard.edu/people/chinmay-shukla), [Harvard Biotech Club](http://thebiotechclub.org/leadership-team/) and Harvard India Student Group. I also started a new student group on campus - [Harvard Big Data Association in GSAS (HBDA)](http://harvardbigdata.com). HBDA focuses on building data science skills among students, acting as a bridge between companies and graduate students and raising awareness about data science topics in the wider Harvard community.

Before coming to graduate school at Harvard, I got a bachelors and masters degree in biotechnology from Indian Institute of Technology Madras. I loved my time at IIT Madras and after a rocky start in my first semester, I went on to recieve several awards for best acadmeic perfomance. During my time at IIT Madras, I also spent a summer doing research at Yale University and another summer at University of Wisconsin Madison as a Khorana Scholar.

I am keenly interested in healthcare and so outside lab, I work as a Health journalist with The Munich Eye and write science articles about the influence of economics, psychology, artificial intelligence in the healthcare field.
