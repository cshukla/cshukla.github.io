<p>My first research paper was published in March 2016 and described the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27009974">new local repeats we found in FIRRE lncRNA</a>. Below is an image with all the local repeats we found in FIRRE. In the paper, we demonstrated that Repeat R0 works as an enhancer element while Repeat RRD is neccessary and sufficient as a nuclear localization signal.</p>
